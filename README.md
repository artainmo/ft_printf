# ft_printf

42 school [subject](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/13690/en.subject.pdf).

A C project with limited access to functions wherein we need to rewrite the printf function.

You can use this project with our [associated unit-test](https://github.com/artainmo/ft_printf-unittest).

## Retrospective note
This project's structure is not clean. No subfolders are used. The [libft](https://github.com/artainmo/libft) is not used as a library.<br>
It is not a great example of how to write a C program unfortunately.
